"The waterfall project management lifecycle":

Stages: The waterfall lifecycle consists of five stages: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.
Sequential Process: This approach works well when project goals and solutions are clearly defined, with each stage completed before moving to the next.
Best Use Cases: Ideal for straightforward projects with little uncertainty, such as building construction, where the scope and deliverables are clear.
