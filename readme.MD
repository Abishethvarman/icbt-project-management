Planning: Includes defining project scope, gathering requirements, identifying deliverables, and building a detailed schedule.

Skills Required: Project managers need technical skills specific to project management, business expertise, problem-solving abilities, and strong interpersonal skills.
Leadership: Effective project managers exhibit strong leadership, inspiring and guiding their teams to achieve project goals.

"The waterfall project management lifecycle":


Stages: The waterfall lifecycle consists of five stages: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing.
Sequential Process: This approach works well when project goals and solutions are clearly defined, with each stage completed before moving to the next.
Best Use Cases: Ideal for straightforward projects with little uncertainty, such as building construction, where the scope and deliverables are clear. 


"The agile project management lifecycle":

Iterative Process: Agile projects use Sprints to deliver production-quality features at regular intervals, allowing for continuous improvement and customer feedback.
Customer Involvement: The customer is more involved throughout the project, providing feedback that helps improve the overall solution.

Agile Lifecycle Stages: The stages include envisioning (defining product vision and initial goals), speculating (planning and prioritizing features), exploring (building and delivering features), and adapting. 

Organization Structure 

"How organizational culture affects projects":

Organizational culture: It includes shared values, beliefs, assumptions, habits, and language that guide behaviors and decisions.
Impact on projects: Projects aligned with the company's mission receive more attention and resources. Leadership styles and work environments also significantly influence project success.
Rules vs. innovation: Some cultures prioritize strict adherence to rules, while others encourage innovation and new approaches.
Change management: The approach to change management varies based on the organization's risk tolerance.
Cultural differences: Team members from different cultural backgrounds may have varying reactions and communication styles, which need to be managed effectively.
